    <section class="main-content">
      <p>Welcome to my (<a href="https://github.com/chaoskagami" class="user-mention">@chaoskagami</a>) github homepage. Really, this is just the obligatory about me page.</p>

<p>I love linux - and I use hardened gentoo as my primary os. Yes, and on a laptop. With X. The higher security margin is something I like to have nowadays, with all of the stuff coming out about privacy and security. (Hi NSA!) My kernel is manually patched - don't expect obvious exploits, script kiddies. ;P</p>

<p>I love games. You should expect to see at least one game-related project show up in a year.</p>

<p>I love making devices do things they shouldn't or aren't made to do. Like my phone, my ipod touch, my PSP, my hp touchpad, my Wii, etc. etc. They're all at least one of the following: Jailbroken, Rooted, Running a custom ROM, running custom firmware, or running a Linux system on /. I do this for the control I get (like using a PSP as a TV remote, or android on an iTouch, etc), not for illicit things. I like games, I like software, and I'm not a cheap bastard. Just making that clear.</p>

<p>I love coding. Largely, I love to follow silly impulses and do spur of the moment coding projects. So I commonly end up doing ports since they can be done quickly. Some of these will remain in limbo since they're unauthorized, and I'd have to make a tool to supply your own input files. For example - running Analogue: A Hate Story on android. Which I own.</p>

<hr>

<p>Currently, I'm working on these projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/chaoskagami/MaihanaTL">Maihana Ao Makyou ~ Uniting Barrage Action Tools</a> - A badass Touhou fangame from the same people who made Croixleur, Souvenir Circle. Unfortunately, not translated. These tools and scripts aim to fix that. Currently, the tools aren't capable of injecting graphics or menu text, sadly.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/chaoskagami/scangrab">scangrab</a> - Tool for fetching scanlated manga from multiple sites and some generics (foolslide, mainly...) No, I will never implement mangafox. Have fun supporting pirates and reading shitty quality watermarked scans. Due to the fact that there's two NSFW fetching modules (fakku, e-h) I may have to make a SFW branch and make it the default for correctness like youtube-dl.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>These are things that have been basically 'completed' and probably will only get bug fixes if I find something terribly wrong with them or someone has a suggestion:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/chaoskagami/FSNConverter-Linux">Fate/Stay Night VNDS Converter (linux)</a> - A direct port of the Fate/Stay Night VNDS converter over at <a href="http://weeaboo.nl/">http://weeaboo.nl/</a>, altered as necessary to run on my native system of choice. Why not just use it in wine? Because java. Java may or may not function in wine, and it's a security flaw as far as I'm concerned to let it anywhere near wine. So nope. The good news; it now works 100% and the source is now GNU C and C++. The bad news; I can't guarantee every edge case works since some of the developers coded things with Windows APIs when they could have used other things. For one example, I had to add typedefs for DWORD, WORD, and LONG. Not only that, but they actually wrote long once. 64-bit linux's long is 64 bits, but they meant an s32. Basically, porting, etc. etc.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/chaoskagami/vndc">VNDC is not a Direct Clone (of VNDS)</a> - A clone of the VNDS interpreter at weaboo. While I love their goal, I don't love the concept of converting a proprietary game to run on another proprietary engine (which is $2.00. Making money off modders is smart, but also dickish.) It just doesn't sit right. So, with the power of open source, SHUT UP AND HAVE A BETTER VERSION. No, seriously. There's more features. If you actually wanted to make a visual novel in VNDC, it would be easier than vnds. Also, it's coded entirely from scratch as a reimplementation. Partially to testbed Zero, which is a code layer I'll probably release at some point.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/chaoskagami/chaos-overlay">Chaos Overlay</a> - My overlay for gentoo. If an ebuild hasn't been updated quick enough, or there's no official ebuild, or another overlay isn't doing their job, and I need it, it'll be in here. Don't use the unstable branch; it's for testing-changing-retesting-changing so I can push to master. This probably won't get commits as often as when I started it, but I will update ebuilds as necessary.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/chaoskagami/chaos-overlay">Gentoo Wine SLOTs and Multiple Versions</a> - Inside of my overlay. See, Skyrim (one of my favorite games) - SKSE specifically, doesn't work with my 1.7.26 ebuild. I had to downgrade, but I wasn't satisfied at that. You'll need to stuff app-emulation/wine::chaos, app-admin/eselect-wine::chaos, and virtual/wine into package.unmask, and then emerge virtual/wine. All of the versions installed end up in /usr/lib/wine/{version}. eselect-wine allows for switching the system version used - note that a user version is impossible right now since I would need to make some patches to load from a location other than /usr/share/wine. Currently eselect-wine symlinks that. Therefore, I'll possibly make a new version at some point, and make r1/r2 of all the ebuilds. I <em>may</em> create a secondary overlay with just these on my github, and remove it from chaos.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>These are on hold for reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/chaoskagami/RCOMage">RCOMage fork</a> - Tool for compiling/extracting PSP resource files. See, this tool had some major potential, but then zinga dropped off the earth. A guy ported it to linux, and that was it. Many features left missing (read: how the hell do I convert gim images without windows) lead me to hack on some of the leftovers in the todo. After I finish the gim&lt;-&gt;bmp code and some minor other stuff, I'll move it to the maintainance list.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/chaoskagami/cm_roth_xml">nVidia Shield Cyanogenmod</a> - I was sitting around, and wondering why this hadn't occurred yet, and why the xda forums were so dead in the shield section. Here's my answer. That said, I nuked my system with six cores in favor of a reinstall and 240GB on an SSD is not nearly enough to build a full android, heh. As an aside, nvidia's source code will not build into something usable.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/chaoskagami/expanel">EXPanel</a>  - A fork of BMPanel, which died in 2008. Likely because the author's readme says on the system tray topic - "Non-standards can die". Well, it's 2014 and that standard is dead, so I'm doing some major core changes - the theme format sucks parameter naming and organization-wise, the documentation is terrible: typing <code>bmpanel --help</code> tells me to read INFO and go through the source, and last but not least, the systray bitrotted. I was coding this really out of boredom one day, so it will probably just rot until I feel like messing with it.</li>
<li>Other stuff that's not terribly important.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the rare offchance you want to donate to me, and like what I do, send some bitcoins to:

<p>My <a href="https://keybase.io/chaoskagami">Keybase.io</a> profile.</p>

<p>I don't use the google analytics feature github provides. Tracking is evil. Why should I do it? ;P</p>
