        <p>Welcome to my (<a href="https://github.com/chaoskagami" class="user-mention">@chaoskagami</a>) github homepage. Really, this is just the obligatory about me page.</p>

<p>I love linux - and I use hardened gentoo as my primary os. Yes, and on a laptop. With X. The higher security margin is something I like to have nowadays, with all of the stuff coming out about privacy and security. My kernel is manually patched - don't expect obvious exploits, script kiddies ;P</p>

<p>I love games. You should expect to see at least one game-related project show up in a year.</p>

<p>I love making devices do things they shouldn't or aren't made to do. Like my phone, my ipod touch, my PSP, my hp touchpad, my Wii, etc. etc. They're all at least one of the following: Jailbroken, Rooted, Running a custom ROM, running custom firmware, or running a Linux system on /.</p>

<hr><p>Currently, I'm working on these projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/chaoskagami/chaos-overlay">Chaos Overlay</a> - My overlay for gentoo. If an ebuild hasn't been updated quick enough, or there's no official ebuild, or another overlay isn't doing their job, and I need it, it'll be in here. Don't use the unstable branch; it's for testing-changing-retesting-changing so I can push to master.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://github.com/chaoskagami/cm_roth_xml">nVidia Shield Cyanogenmod</a> - I was sitting around, and wondering why this hadn't occurred yet, and why the xda forums were so dead in the shield section. Here's my answer.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/chaoskagami/expanel">EXPanel</a>  - A fork of BMPanel, which died in 2008. Likely because the author's readme says on the system tray topic - "Non-standards can die". Well, it's 2014 and that standard is dead, so I'm doing some major core changes - the theme format sucks parameter naming and organization-wise, the documentation is terrible: typing <code>bmpanel --help</code> tells me to read INFO and go through the source, and last but not least, the systray bitrotted. No, I won't stand for this. Time for an update.</li>
<li>Other stuff that's not terribly important.</li>
</ul><hr><p>I don't use the google analytics feature. Tracking is evil. ;P</p>
